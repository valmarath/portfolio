Portfolio is the website that I use as my curriculum in most cases. It shows some of my projects and programming languages that I code. Also, there's general contact information to reach me and links of my social midia accounts, such as linkedin, instagram, github. It's a one page website designed and coded considering mobile first, using HTML, CSS and JS.

## See Portfolio in action

- The easiest way is to just access this [link](https://portfolio-92a91.web.app/).

- Or, you can download all files and open the [index.html](https://github.com/valmarath/portfolio/blob/main/index.html) file on your browser;

- To test the responsive features, you can use the inspect option to change the dimensions as you please and see how it responds;

- You can also click on the links of social midia, projects or programming languages and see what happens.
